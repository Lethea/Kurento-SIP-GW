## Synopsis

This project is a basic WebRTC to SIP gateway. It uses [drachtio](https://github.com/davehorton/drachtio) for SIP signaling and [Kurento](https://www.kurento.org/) for the Media Server.
This node application was made using [Kurent-tutorial-node/helloworld](https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node/tree/master/kurento-hello-world).
Html client UI is made using Login/Logout Animation Concept by Nikolay Talanov
http://codepen.io/suez/pen/dPqxoM.

## Motivation

This gateway was made to easily connect a browser to any classic SIP endpoint like Softphone, PABX or MCU.
It was firstly designed to work with Asterisk and it works with it.

## Installation

First, install  [Kurento-media-server](https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-media-server) (with a cotrun server it's better) :

```bash
echo "deb http://ubuntu.kurento.org trusty kms6" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kurento.list
wget -O - http://ubuntu.kurento.org/kurento.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install kurento-server
```

Next, install  [drachtio-server](https://github.com/davehorton/drachtio-server) :

```bash
git clone --depth=50 --branch=master git://github.com/davehorton/drachtio-server.git && cd drachtio-server
git submodule update --init --recursive
./bootstrap.sh
mkdir build && cd $_
../configure CPPFLAGS='-DNDEBUG'
make
sudo make install
```

And finally, install node modules :
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration
Change config.serverPublicIP in file config.js to expose external  public IP used for SIP sdp generation.

config.kurento.as_uri is for HTTPS node server, default=8443.
config.kurento.ws_uri is for Kurento-media-sever uri, default='ws://localhost:8888/kurento'

## To run
```bash
node server.js
```

Open https://localhost:8443/ and fill a userName and a destination number like 999@192.168.0.11 and click on Start Call.

Kurento-SIP-GW will send an invite to destination and connect media after call accept by remote end.

## Current Limitations

* Only a SIP inviter to other endpoint
* No STUN/TURN/ICE support on SIP/RTP side

## Roadmap

 1. Add DTMF support (soon)
 2. Add SIP REGISTER
 3. Add incoming call support
 4. Codec selection
 5. Call control API and administrator UI
 6. Build unit Test
 7. Run load Test
