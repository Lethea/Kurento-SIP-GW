## Synopsis

This project is a basic WebRTC to SIP gateway. It uses drachtio for SIP signaling and Kurento for the Media Server.  

## Motivation

This gateway was made to easily connect a browser to any classic SIP endpoint like Softphone, PABX or MCU.
It was firstly designed to work with Asterisk.

## Installation

Firstly install  Kurento-media-server (with a cotrun server it's better) and drachtio server in your local host.

Next install node modules :
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration
Change config.serverPublicIP in file config.js to expose public IP used for SIP sdp generation.

## To run
```bash
node server.js
```

Open https://localhost:8443/ and fill a userName and a destination number like 999@192.168.0.11 and click on Start Call.

Kurento-SIP-GW will send an invite to destination and connect media after call accept by remote end.
